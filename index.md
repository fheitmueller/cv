I am an associate post-doctoral researcher at the [International Centre
for Tax and Development (ICTD)](https://www.ictd.ac/) and a Teacher at
Leiden University’s Institute for Tax Law and Economics. I complete a
PhD in the [GLOBTAXGOV
Project](https://globtaxgov.weblog.leidenuniv.nl/) at Leiden University
in March 2024. My research focuses on policies against corporate tax
avoidance, the influence of international norms in the Global South and
tax policy for development. I work in an interdisciplinary way and I aim
at contributing to the state of the art in political science and tax law
scholarship.
